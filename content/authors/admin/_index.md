Welcome! I am a postdoctoral researcher at [PROSPER](https://www.clsbe.lisboa.ucp.pt/faculty-knowledge/research/knowledge-hubs/prosper-center-economics-prosperity) at [Cat√≥lica Lisbon School of Business & Economics](https://www.clsbe.lisboa.ucp.pt/).

My research aims to understand labour markets, both from a theoretical and an applied perspective. My research questions are related to how workers and firms match, and why skill mismatches occur. I am also interested in informal employment in developing countries.
